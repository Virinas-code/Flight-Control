Structure:
One submodule for each software
- Airport (manage flights, booking and all that shit)
- Terminal (just displays flights)
- ATC (does it name and displays it and allows you to interact with it)
- Aircraft (I hope, autopilot also)
- Facility (like ILS stuff and all that crap I know nothing about)
- Ground ()
